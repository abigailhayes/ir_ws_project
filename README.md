## Task description

The goal of Task 1 is supporting researchers find the most relevant documents regarding a head query. Participants are asked to define and implement their ranking approach for a multi-lingual candidate documents list. A good ranking should present users with the most relevant documents regarding a query on top of the result set. Multiple languages can be used to pose the query (e.g. English, German, French); regardless of the language used on the query, the retrieval can include candidate documents in other languages.

## Data

Data is stored in the "candidates" folder. This consists of training data with 1000 entries and the test data with 100 entries.
