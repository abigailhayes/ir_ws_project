1,87,copd,M32239444,Medication Compliance in COPD Patients.,"['Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most severe public health problems and a leading cause of death worldwide. One of the main reasons for poor control of the disease is low patient compliance with treatment plan. The aim of the study was to investigate sociodemographic and health status factors that may have an influence on adherence to treatment. There were 106 inpatients (F/M, 42/64; mean age 70\xa0±\xa06\xa0years) with COPD enrolled into this retrospective study. Patients completed the Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale (ARMS) to assess adherence to therapy. We found that the mean ARMS score was 23.1\xa0±\xa06.8. About 86% of patients had low adherence, and 14% had good adherence (mean score 3.2\xa0±\xa02.4). The low-adherence patients were more likely to be older (p\xa0=\xa00.020), female (p\xa0=\xa00.011), single (p\xa0=\xa00.019), not professionally active (p\xa0=\xa00.049), hospitalized more often (p\xa0=\xa00.005) and for a longer time (p\xa0=\xa00.046), feel worse (p\xa0=\xa00.023), experience a greater impact of the disease on sleep quality (p\xa0=\xa00.008) and daily activities (p\xa0=\xa00.001), and had a higher GOLD stage of COPD when compared to patients with good adherence patients (p\xa0=\xa00.012). Multiple factor analysis demonstrates that independent adverse predictors of the ARMS score included the following: being single (OR\xa0=\xa03.18), having had more than eight hospitalizations (OR\xa0=\xa01.18), and experiencing dysfunction in daily activities (OR\xa0=\xa01.79). Male gender (OR\xa0=\xa00.77) and longer than 21-day hospitalizations (OR\xa0=\xa00.93) were independent positive predictors of adherence. In conclusion, COPD patients demonstrate a low level of adherence to pharmacotherapy. Adherence is adversely affected by sociodemographic (older age, female gender, being single, and professionally inactive) and clinical factors (more frequent hospitalizations, perception of poor well-being, disordered sleep and daily functioning, and a higher GOLD stage).']"
2,87,copd,M31730394,Genetics of COPD.,"['Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk is strongly influenced by cigarette smoking, genetic factors are also important determinants of COPD. In addition to Mendelian syndromes such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, many genomic regions that influence COPD susceptibility have been identified in genome-wide association studies. Similarly, multiple genomic regions associated with COPD-related phenotypes, such as quantitative emphysema measures, have been found. Identifying the functional variants and key genes within these association regions remains a major challenge. However, newly identified COPD susceptibility genes are already providing novel insights into COPD pathogenesis. Network-based approaches that leverage these genetic discoveries have the potential to assist in decoding the complex genetic architecture of COPD.']"
4,87,copd,M31694841,Sphingolipids in COPD.,"['Sphingolipids are a distinct class of lipid molecules widely found in nature, principally as cell membrane constituents. After initial uncertainty about their function, sphingolipids have been increasingly recognised to be metabolically active entities involved in many biological processes, including the control of inflammation. Their role as mediators of inflammation may have significant implications for a range of lung diseases in which inflammation is a central element of pathogenesis. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a highly prevalent and morbid condition predominantly affecting cigarette smokers, is a prime example of a respiratory illness with an inflammatory component. Understandably, sphingolipids have received growing attention for their increasingly demonstrated role in the pathophysiology of COPD. The present review aims to be among the first to focus exclusively on the connection between sphingolipids and lung inflammation in COPD, providing the reader with a clinically oriented synopsis of this intriguing association.']"

At any stage in the course of the disease, acute exacerbations of COPD may occur and lead to accelerated deterioration of pulmonary function. A key factor of COPD is airway remodelling, which refers to the serious alterations of the ECM affecting airway wall thickness, resistance and elasticity. Various studies have shown that serum biomarkers of ECM turnover are significantly associated with disease severity in patients with COPD and may serve as potential targets to control airway inflammation and remodelling in COPD. Unravelling the complete molecular composition of the ECM in the diseased lungs will help to identify novel biomarkers for disease progression and therapy.']"

Inhaled long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are equally effective for the symptomatic management of COPD. However, LAMAs are more effective than LABAs in the reduction of exacerbations. In patients with symptomatic COPD pharmacologic therapy is usually escalated using the fixed combination of LAMAs and LABAs (dual bronchodilation), which is also superior to LAMA monotherapy in the prevention of exacerbations. Adding inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to LABA and LAMA (triple therapy) for a prevention of exacerbations results in a further reduction of exacerbations, especially in those patients with higher blood eosinophil counts. Non-pharmacologic management of COPD patients includes smoking cessation programs, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation, and strategies to improve or maintain their physical activity.']"

Mass spectrometric and immunostaining measurements of lungs from 69 COPD, 16 smokers without COPD and 13 subjects with interstitial lung disease identified decoupling of lung ceramide and sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) levels and decreased sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) activity in COPD.

In this study we investigated the prevalence of RS without nasal polyps (RSsNP) and the severity of sinonasal symptoms in COPD and a corresponding control group. We also evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of these symptoms for RSsNP in COPD. 90 COPD patients and 93 controls were included in an observational cross-sectional study where globally accepted diagnostic criteria of RS and COPD (EPOS 2012 and GOLD) were incorporated; symptomatic and endoscopic criteria for the diagnosis of RS, and spirometry with reversibility for diagnosis of COPD. RS symptoms were identified by responses to the sinonasal outcome test (SNOT-22), nasal endoscopy identified signs of sinonasal disease and discriminated between RS with and without nasal polyps, and visual analogue scales (VAS) rated the severity of sinonasal symptoms. We found RSsNP in 51% of our COPD patients which is threefold greater than in the control group (p<0.001). Nasal discharge (72%) and nasal obstruction (62%) were the two most frequently reported symptoms in COPD. The diagnostic accuracy for RSsNP is better for the composite VAS for rhinological symptoms than for facial symptoms. We conclude that RSsNP is present in 51% of our COPD patients, which is significantly more prevalent compared to a corresponding control group.

Therefore, we sought to investigate the effects of passive music therapy (listening to music) and mixed music (combination of listening and singing) in adults with COPD.!##!Methods!#!A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, and Wanfang Data up to June 26, 2019. All randomized controlled trials that compared music with usual care or other non-musical types of intervention in subjects with COPD were included in the study. The risk of bias for randomized controlled trials was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Outcomes included dyspnea, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and quality of life, as well as physiological parameters (eg, blood pressure and breathing frequency).!##!Results!#!After initial screening of 216 potentially relevant records, 59 studies were eligible, and 12 studies with 812 participates met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final meta-analysis. Analysis showed that music therapy had a significant effect in relieving dyspnea (mean difference: -0.69, 95% CI -0.80 to -0.58, !##!Conclusions!#!Music therapy is effective in reducing dyspnea and anxiety in subjects with COPD. Additionally, music therapy may also improve sleep quality and physiological parameters of subjects with COPD. However, our conclusions need to be supported further by larger and longer well-designed trials.']"
69,87,copd,M32265292,Impact of Radiographic Bronchiectasis in COPD.,"[""Background!#!COPD and bronchiectasis frequently coexist, which creates an emerging phenotype with a worse prognosis. However, the impact of bronchiectasis on the natural history of COPD has not been fully evaluated and is still controversial. This meta-analysis was performed to clarify the associations of the presence of bronchiectasis with the prognosis and quality of life of patients with COPD.!##!Methods!#!A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed following a search of medical databases, and included articles published up to April 2019. The following outcome measures were analyzed: age, sex, smoking history, body mass index, exacerbation rate, lung function, inflammatory biomarkers, albumin, colonization by potentially pathogenic microorganisms, !##!Results!#!A total of 415,257 subjects with COPD from 18 observational studies were eligible; bronchiectasis was present in 25,929 subjects (6.24%). The coexistence of COPD and bronchiectasis occurred more often in older subjects with lower body mass index. The presence of bronchiectasis in the subjects with COPD increased the risk of daily sputum production (odds ratio [OR] 1.80, 95% CI 1.24-2.61), exacerbation (weighted mean difference [WMD] 0.72 times, 95% CI 0.59-0.85), frequent hospital admissions (WMD 0.35 times, 95% CI 0.21-0.49), and follow-up (>3 years) mortality (OR 2.26, 95% CI 0.95-5.36). The subjects with COPD and bronchiectasis showed poorer pulmonary function (FEV!##!Conclusions!#!This meta-analysis confirmed the significant associations of the presence of bronchiectasis with the natural history, disease course, and outcomes in COPD. The COPD-bronchiectasis phenotype had adverse effects on subjects' health condition and prognosis.""]"
72,87,copd,M33442246,Towards Personalized Management of Sarcopenia in COPD.,"['The awareness of the presence and consequences of sarcopenia has significantly increased over the past decade. Sarcopenia is defined as gradual loss of muscle mass and strength and ultimately loss of physical performance associated with aging and chronic disease. The prevalence of sarcopenia is higher in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared to age-matched controls. Current literature suggests that next to physical inactivity, COPD-specific alterations in physiological processes contribute to accelerated development of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia in COPD can be assessed according to current guidelines, but during physical performance testing, ventilatory limitation should be considered. Treatment of muscle impairment can halt or even reverse sarcopenia, despite respiratory impairment. Exercise training and protein supplementation are currently at the basis of sarcopenia treatment. Furthermore, effective current and new interventions targeting the pulmonary system (eg, smoking cessation, bronchodilators and lung volume reduction surgery) may also facilitate muscle maintenance. Better understanding of disease-specific pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the accelerated development of sarcopenia in COPD will provide new leads to refine nutritional, exercise and physical activity interventions and develop pharmacological co-interventions.']"
