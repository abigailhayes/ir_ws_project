{"DBRECORDID": "NLM101675156", "TITLE": ["Dementia"], "ABSTRACT": ["Dementia, a broad category of brain diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, affects millions of people worldwide. Although its impact is primarily focused on populations of Western countries, orthodox medicine has not been able to discover the causes of dementia, let alone develop successful treatments or a cure. Given this situation, there are good reasons to investigate the psycho-spiritual factors connected to the outbreak of the illness. As the author states in her Preface: 'The conception of man that is given priority today by the scientific world hardly takes into account that in addition to the physical-material component, for which certain degenerative or pathological processes can be determined with the help of technical apparatus, there are other components of his being to be taken into account which cannot be investigated in that way. So long as the cause of an illness is not sought in connection with those spiritual components of the human being, a successful treatment of the patient cannot be assured.' Developing successful methods of treatment requires a full understanding of the human being.This can not be achieved through observation with the outer senses only, but increasingly calls for spiritual-scientific perception. Through this method, as founded by Rudolf Steiner, great service can be rendered to humanity, including precise research into the causes of ill-health. The factors involved in the eruption of modern afflictions, such as dementia, can be determined by careful consideration of humanity's - as well as the individual's - destiny. In this succinct but rich study, Judith von Halle describes her investigations into the phenomenon of dementia, beginning with a general outline of the anthroposophical conception of the human being and society, and applying that knowledge to what today is increasingly referred to as an epidemic. This book does not demand medical expertise, but requires an effort to engage with the psycho-spiritual conditions of dementia sufferers. It provides a wealth of insights and guidance to approaching one of the greatest challenges of our time."], "LANGUAGE": ["eng"], "MESH": ["Dementia", "Anthroposophy", "Spirituality"]}

{"DBRECORDID": "NLM101524269", "TITLE": ["Dementia"], "ABSTRACT": ["\"Growth in the incidence of dementia presents major challenges to global healthcare systems. As the burden of dementia in non-Western cultures grows, developing nations are expected to overtake developed nations in terms of dementia prevalence. Insights from developing nations and transcultural considerations are, nevertheless, neglected in the published literature. Dementia: A Global Approach fills this gap by integrating contemporary cross-cultural knowledge about dementia. Each section reviews the literature from the published, predominantly Western, perspective, contrasting it with empirical knowledge from non-Western cultures. Covering major clinical, epidemiological and scientific areas of interest, detailed consideration is also given to care-giving models across the world and management of patients who have migrated between regions. Enriched with personal insights from clinical experts across the globe, this is a key text for neurologists, geriatricians, psychiatrists, psychologists, epidemiologists and all those responsible for managing provisions of dementia services\"--Provided by publisher."], "LANGUAGE": ["eng"], "MESH": ["Dementia/epidemiology", "Dementia/therapy", "Cross-Cultural Comparison"]}
