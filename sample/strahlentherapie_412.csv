The aim of this project was to integrate all documents independent of their source (paper-bound or digital) and to make content from the BAS available in a structured manner. As many workflow steps as possible should be automated, e.g. assigning a document to a patient in the BAS. Additionally it must be guaranteed that at all times it could be traced who, when, how and from which source documents were imported into the departmental system. Furthermore work procedures should be changed that the documentation conducted either directly in the departmental system or from external systems can be incorporated digitally and paper document can be completely avoided (e.g. documents such as treatment certificate, treatment plans or documentation). It was a further aim, if possible, to automate the removal of paper documents from the departmental work flow, or even to make such paper documents superfluous. In this way patient letters for follow-up appointments should automatically generated from the BAS. Similarly patient record extracts in the form of PDF files should be enabled, e.g. for controlling purposes.!##!Method!#!The available document qualities were analysed in detail by a multidisciplinary working group (BAS-AG) and after this examination and assessment of the possibility of modelling in our departmental workflow (BAS) they were transcribed into a flow diagram. The gathered specifications were implemented in a test environment by the clinical and administrative IT group of the department of radiation oncology and subsequent to a detailed analysis introduced into clinical routine.!##!Results!#!The department has succeeded under the conditions of the aforementioned criteria to embed all relevant documents in the departmental workflow via continuous processes. Since the completion of the concepts and the implementation in our test environment 15,000 documents were introduced into the departmental workflow following routine approval.

By improving the surgical technique the local recurrence rate could be reduced by TME surgery alone to below 8\u2009%. Even if local control was further improved by additional preoperative irradiation this did not lead to a general survival benefit. Guidelines advocate that all patients in UICC stage II and III should be pretreated; however, the stage-based indications for neoadjuvant therapy have limitations. This is mainly attributable to the facts that patients with T3 tumors comprise a very heterogeneous prognostic group and preoperative lymph node diagnostics lack accuracy. In contrast, in recent years the circumferential resection margin (CRM) has become an important prognostic parameter. Patients with tumors that are very close to or infiltrate the pelvic fascia (positive CRM) have a higher rate of local recurrence and poorer survival. With high-resolution pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination in patients with rectal cancer, the preoperative CRM can be determined with a high sensitivity and specificity. Improved T staging and better prediction of the resection margins by pelvic MRI potentially facilitate the selection of patients for study-based treatment strategies omitting neoadjuvant radiotherapy.

Regardless of their low incidence, fracture rates between 1,2 and 6,4 % prove their importance. Local tumor control has therefore to be weighed against the resulting decrease in bone quality and stability.

In addition to precise imaging, modern SBRT techniques also use gating and tracking techniques that have made local therapy of liver metastases more effective. In combination with optimisation of central tumour dose, local control rates of up to 90% have been achieved with minimal side effects in less than 1% of patients and 5-year survival rates of more than 30% in selected (inoperable) patient populations. In future, hybrid ultrasound or MRI irradiation systems can overcome fiducial marker implantation. Due to the current outcome data, SBRT is a valuable addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with liver metastases and is a true alternative to minimally invasive ablative procedures or can be used in combination with other local or systemic treatments in an interdisciplinary context.']",

Provided that radiotherapy is applied with a sufficient radiation dose, it is as effective as radical prostatectomy. Different radiation modalities are available (interstitial brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy or a combination of both). Various new developments will further increase the value of radiation-based approaches. In this regard, a wider use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) will result in higher treatment doses with even lower toxicity rates. Combinations of radiotherapy and hormonal ablation improve local control rates in defined groups of patients.

Sonography is one promising option, which is now on the brink of clinical implementation. Ultrasound is particularly suited for this purpose due to the high soft tissue contrast, real-time capability, the absence of ionizing radiation and low acquisition costs. Ultrasound motion tracking is an image-based approach, i.e. the target volume or an adjacent structure is directly monitored and the motion is tracked automatically on the ultrasound image. Diverse algorithms are presently available that provide the real-time target coordinates from 2D as well as 3D images. Definition of a suitable sonographic window is not, however, trivial and a gold standard for positioning and mounting of the transducer has not yet been developed. Furthermore, processing of the coordinate information in the therapy unit and the dynamic adaptation of the radiation field are challenging tasks.!##!Conclusion!#!It is not clear whether ultrasound motion tracking will become established in the clinical routine although all technical prerequisites can be considered as fulfilled, such that exciting progress in this field of research is still to be expected.']",

The common indication for radiation therapy in urology is prostate cancer, which collaterally affects the urinary bladder and rarely urethra (especially the bulbo-membranous urethra). Ureteral damage and stricture formation is almost always restricted to the cases of intraoperative therapy and external beam radiation therapy for other urological malignancies (gynecological organs, rectum, retroperitoneal soft tissue tumors) and should not be underestimated.

In (external) radiation therapy they are increasingly used for the calculation of dose distributions during treatment planning. In comparison to other algorithms for the calculation of dose distributions, Monte Carlo methods have the capability of improving the accuracy of dose calculations - especially under complex circumstances (e.g. consideration of inhomogeneities). However, there is a lack of knowledge of how accurate the results of Monte Carlo calculations are on an absolute basis. A practical verification of the calculations can be performed by direct comparison with the results of a benchmark experiment. This work presents such a benchmark experiment and compares its results (with detailed consideration of measurement uncertainty) with the results of Monte Carlo calculations using the well-established Monte Carlo code EGSnrc. The experiment was designed to have parallels to external beam radiation therapy with respect to the type and energy of the radiation, the materials used and the kind of dose measurement. Because the properties of the beam have to be well known in order to compare the results of the experiment and the simulation on an absolute basis, the benchmark experiment was performed using the research electron accelerator of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), whose beam was accurately characterized in advance. The benchmark experiment and the corresponding Monte Carlo simulations were carried out for two different types of ionization chambers and the results were compared. Considering the uncertainty, which is about 0.7\xa0% for the experimental values and about 1.0\xa0% for the Monte Carlo simulation, the results of the simulation and the experiment coincide. ']",
